- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) instead of `npm`
   
   You'll know you've installed yarn right if you can run: `yarn --version` and get an output like: `x.x.x`

  > You can read more about how to use that repo from its [README.md](https://github.com/Meno96/hardhat-smartcontract-lottery/blob/master/README.md)


- Add hardhat network to your metamask/wallet

  - Get the RPC_URL of your hh node (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8545/`)
  - Go to your wallet and add a new network. [See instructions here.](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043227612-How-to-add-a-custom-network-RPC)
    - Network Name: Hardhat-Localhost
    - New RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545/
    - Chain ID: 31337
    - Currency Symbol: ETH (or GO)
    - Block Explorer URL: None

- Ideally, you'd then [import one of the accounts](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489331-How-to-import-an-Account) from hardhat to your wallet/metamask. 

- Run this code

  Back in a different terminal with the code from this repo, run:

  ```
  yarn dev
  ```
- Go to UI and have fun!
